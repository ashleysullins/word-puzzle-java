# word-puzzle-java

## Synopsis

This program will convert any word or phrase into a puzzle by removing the vowels, except for y.

## Motivation

This is an exercise completed at the end of the first week of Epicodus, a code school, to see if we have sucessfully learned the basics of Java, Git, Spark and Gradle.

## Installation

In order to run the application, you'll need to type ``gradle run`` on your command line. All additional libraries will be installed after running gradle.

## Tests

There are both unit and integration tests associated with this application. The test files can be found under /src/test/java in the ``AppIntegrationTest.java`` and ``AppUnitTest.java`` files. To run the test suite, you'll need to type ``gradle test`` in your command line.
